Virtualization revolutionized computing by enabling multiple operating systems and applications to run on a single physical server, maximizing resource utilization. It enhances scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency in IT infrastructures. By abstracting hardware, virtualization facilitates seamless migration, backup, and recovery processes. It's a cornerstone of modern cloud computing and data center management.
